# One_handed_projects
Learning and mini-projects with an attention-seeking cat at my left hand

As I go through my resume and cover letter for the job search, I have found myself having to relearn skills that were once immediately accessible. Therefore, I have created this repository for refresher projects intended to give myself some practice and hold myself accountable to the learning process.

My initial focus will be on Python projects as I work through the Python Crash Course and Real World Python books.

Follow along with me as I try to singlehandedly (literally, this cat will not remove himself from my personal space) relearn how to code!
